# 🧹 Data Cleaning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Data Cleaning Projects Repository**!  
This repo is a collection of messy datasets I’ve generated or sourced, along with the complete cleaning workflows I’ve applied to make them analysis-ready.  

The goal is to demonstrate **real-world data cleaning skills** that are essential for a Data Analyst role.

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

- Each project has its own folder:
  - `raw_data/` → Messy dataset (CSV or other format).
  - `cleaning_script/` → Python scripts or notebooks with cleaning steps.
  - `README.md` → Project-specific explanation.

---

## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated

- Handling **missing values** (rule-based imputation, placeholders, dropping irrelevant rows).
- Detecting and treating **outliers**.
- Standardizing **categorical values** (case normalization, mapping inconsistent labels).
- Converting **data types** (dates, numeric, categorical).
- Removing **duplicates** and enforcing primary key logic.
- **Feature engineering**
- Business-friendly explanations of cleaning decisions.

## 📌 Why This Repo?
Data cleaning is the **foundation of data analysis**.  
By compiling multiple projects here, I aim to show:
- My ability to handle diverse messy datasets
- My growth in applying best practices
- My readiness for real-world Data Analyst roles
